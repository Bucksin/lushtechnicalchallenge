Buck sin

I created this script to complete the following objectives using automated browser commands.

1. Navigate to the Lush Website (https://www.lush.ca)
2. Accesses the navigation menu and clicks into a link for all bath/shower products
3. Adds two bath products to the cart
4. Navigates to the cart page
4. Screencaptures a png file of the cart and saves it to the local TestResults folder

To run this script, clone this repo to your local drive on your computer. Note that I did not upload node_modules to git since the puppeteer modules were too large. Therefore, to run the script, you will need to install puppeteer on you local computer. Open your command prompt/terminal and cd into your repo directory named "LushDeveloperChallenge". Then enter into your terminal "npm install puppeteer". Once the install is complete, enter "Node index.js" to run the script.
